# React Course Agenda

**Prerequisites:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Terminal, Git, VS Code

**Approach:** React first in JavaScript → TypeScript at the end

---

## Phase 1: React Fundamentals (Weeks 1–3)

### Module 1: Introduction to React

- What is React? Virtual DOM, component-based UI
- Setting up with Vite (no TypeScript template)
- JSX: syntax, expressions, conditional rendering
- Your first component

### Module 2: Components & Props

- Functional components
- Props: passing data, destructuring, default values
- Composition: children, component composition
- Component structure and file organization

### Module 3: State & Events

- `useState` – local state
- Handling events (onClick, onChange, onSubmit)
- Controlled vs uncontrolled inputs
- Forms and form handling
- Lifting state up

---

## Phase 2: React Core (Weeks 4–5)

### Module 4: Hooks Deep Dive

- `useEffect` – side effects, cleanup, dependency array
- `useContext` – sharing state without prop drilling
- `useRef` – DOM refs and mutable values
- `useMemo` & `useCallback` – when and why
- Custom hooks – reusable logic

### Module 5: Data Fetching

- `fetch` and `axios`
- Loading and error states
- React Query (TanStack Query) – caching, refetching, mutations
- Handling API errors

---

## Phase 3: Routing & Navigation (Week 6)

### Module 6: React Router DOM v6

- SPA routing: BrowserRouter, Routes, Route
- Navigation: Link, NavLink, useNavigate
- Dynamic routes: params, useParams
- Nested routes and layouts
- Protected routes (auth flow)
- 404 and error handling

---

## Phase 4: Styling (Week 7)

### Module 7: Tailwind CSS in React

- Tailwind setup with Vite
- Utility classes, responsive design
- Component patterns with Tailwind
- Component libraries: shadcn/ui, Radix UI, Headless UI
- Animations with Framer Motion (intro)

---

## Phase 5: Advanced React (Weeks 8–9)

### Module 8: Performance & Optimization

- React DevTools – profiling
- Code splitting – React.lazy, Suspense
- Memoization – React.memo, useMemo, useCallback
- Virtualization for long lists (react-window)
- Bundle analysis basics

### Module 9: State Management

- When to use Context vs external libraries
- Zustand – simple global state
- Redux Toolkit – slices, thunks, RTK Query
- Choosing the right tool

### Module 10: Testing

- Vitest setup
- React Testing Library – queries, user events
- Testing components and hooks
- MSW for API mocking

---

## Phase 6: Build & Deploy (Week 10)

### Module 11: Project Setup & Deployment

- Project structure and conventions
- ESLint & Prettier
- Environment variables
- Deployment: Vercel, Netlify
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions (intro)

---

## Phase 7: TypeScript (Weeks 11–12)

### Module 12: TypeScript for React

- Why TypeScript in React
- Basic types, interfaces, type inference
- Typing components, props, events
- Typing hooks and custom hooks
- Migrating a JS React project to TS
- Graduation project in TypeScript

---

## Capstone Project

**Full project** (e.g. task manager, blog, dashboard):

- React + Vite
- React Router
- Tailwind CSS
- React Query
- State management (Zustand or Redux Toolkit)
- Auth and protected routes
- Optional: TypeScript version at the end
